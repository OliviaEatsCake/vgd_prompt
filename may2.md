Today I played minecraft education edition, because unfortunatly none of my xbox games tranfer to my computer, and I play console most of the time. 
I worked on the loaf monument map I have created, the whole project is a simple ARG, and i have made a whole storyline and hidden secrets. im still working on it buts its been months in the working. I have this massive temple,and then a guest house, arena, lake and dungeon. 
I like minecraft education edition because, its fun, I like minecraft. I also have made a really massive world that I think is really cool and is very fun to work on.
